A large and lonely ocean with few ships\\n', 'and many rutty spots that need mending.

In the smokeroom, where\\n', 'poker was a daily pastime, resignation was expressed, the impression\\n', 'being that with the lost day went the customary Sunday services. But in\\n', 'reaching this conclusion the smokeroom group had failed to reckon with\\n', 'the fact that missionaries were aboard. The missionaries held a hasty\\n', 'conference in the social hall, and ignoring the irreverent pranks of\\n', 'longitude and time, announced a service for the day that followed\\n', 'Saturday. Upon this a counter-conference was held around the poker\\n', 'table, whereat were reached the following conclusions:\\n', '\\n', \"That aboard ship the captain's will is, and of a right ought to be,\\n\", 'absolute; that the captain had pronounced the day Monday; that in the\\n', 'eyes of this law-abiding though poker-playing group, it therefore _was_\\n', 'Monday; that the proposal to hold church services on Monday constituted\\n', 'an attempt upon the part of certain passengers to set their will above\\n', 'that of the captain; that such action was, in the opinion of the\\n', \"smokeroom group, subversive to the ship's discipline, if indeed it did\\n\", 'not constitute actual mutiny on the high seas; that members of this\\n', 'group could not, therefore, be party to the action proposed; that, upon\\n', 'the contrary, they deemed it their clear duty in this crisis to stand\\n', 'back of the captain; and finally, that in pursuance of this duty they\\n', 'should and would remain in the smokeroom throughout the entire day,\\n', 'carrying on their regular Monday game, even though others might see fit\\n', 'to carry on their regular Sunday game elsewhere in the vessel.\\n', '\\n', '                   *       *       *       *       *\\n', '\\n', 'Had this been the Atlantic crossing we should by now have landed on the\\n', 'other side; yet here we were, pitching upon a cold gray waste a few\\n', 'miles south of Behring Sea, with Yokohama a full week away.\\n', '\\n', 'Yet land--land of a kind--was not so distant as I had imagined. Early\\n', 'one morning in the middle of the voyage my steward, Sugimoto, came to my\\n', 'cabin and woke me up to see it. (A splendid fellow, Sugimoto; short and\\n', 'round of body, with flesh solid and resilient as a hard rubber ball, and\\n', 'a circular sweet face that Raphael might have painted for a cherub, had\\n', 'Raphael been Japanese.)\\n', '\\n', '\"Good morning, gentleman,\" said he. \"Gentleman look porthole, he see\\n', 'land.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I arose and looked.\\n', '\\n', 'A flounce of foam a mile or two away across the water edged the skirt of\\n', 'a dark mountain jutting abruptly from the sea. Through a mist, like a\\n', 'half-raised curtain of gray gauze, I saw a wintry peak from which long\\n', 'tongues of snow trailed downward, marking seams and gorges. It was, in\\n', 'short, just such an island as is discovered in the nick of time by a\\n', 'shipwrecked whaler who, famished and freezing in an open boat, has\\n', 'drifted for days through the storm-tossed pages of a sea story. He would\\n', 'land in a sheltered cove and would quickly discover a spring and a cave.\\n', 'He would devise a skilful means of killing seals, would dress himself in\\n', 'their skins, and subsist upon their meat--preceded by the customary clam\\n', 'and fish courses. For three years he would live upon the island,\\n', 'believing himself alone. Then suddenly would come to him the knowledge\\n', 'that life in this place was no longer safe. About the entrance to his\\n', 'cave he would find the tracks of a predatory animal--fresh prints of\\n', 'French heels in the snow!\\n', '\\n', 'Austere though the island looked, my heart warmed at the sight of it;\\n', 'for there is no land so miserable that it is not to be preferred above\\n', 'the sea. Moreover I saw in this land a harbinger. The Empire of Japan, I\\n', 'knew, consisted of several large islands--to the chief one of which we\\n', 'were bound--and some four thousand smaller ones stretching out in a vast\\n', 'chain. This island, then, must be the first one of the chain. From now\\n', 'on we would no doubt be passing islands every little while. The\\n', 'remainder of the voyage would be like a trip down the St. Lawrence\\n', 'River.\\n', '\\n', 'Soothed and encouraged by this pleasant thought, and wishing always to\\n', 'remember this outpost of the Island Empire, I asked its name of\\n', 'Sugimoto.\\n', '\\n', '\"That Araska, gentleman,\" he answered.\\n', '\\n', '\"Are you glad to see Japan again, Sugimoto?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That Araska,\" he repeated.\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes. A part of Japan, isn\\'t it?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Sugimoto shook his head.\\n', '\\n', '\"No, gentleman. Araska American land.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That island belongs to the United States?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes, gentleman. That Araska.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I had never heard of an island of that name. Surely Sugimoto was\\n', 'mistaken in thinking it an American possession.\\n', '\\n', '\"Could you show it to me on the map?\" I asked.\\n', '\\n', 'From my dresser he took a folder of the steamship company and opening to\\n', 'a map of the Pacific, pointed to one of many little dots. \"Aleutian\\n', 'Islands,\" they were marked. They dangled far, far out from the end of\\n', 'that peninsula which resembles a long tongue hanging from the mouth of a\\n', 'dog, the head of which is rudely suggested by the cartographic outlines\\n', 'of our northernmost territory. We had sailed directly away from our\\n', 'native land for a week, only to find ourselves, at the end of that time,\\n', 'still in sight of its outskirts. Like many another of his fellow\\n', \"countrymen, good Sugimoto had difficulties with his _l_'s and _r_'s. He\\n\", 'had been trying to inform me that the island--the name of which proved\\n', 'to be Amatisnok--belonged to Alaska.\\n', '\\n', 'I began to study the map and look up statistics concerning the Pacific\\n', 'Ocean. It was a great mistake. It is not pleasant to discover that three\\n', 'quarters of the world is worse than wasted, being entirely given over to\\n', 'salt water. Nor is it pleasant to discover, when far out on the Pacific,\\n', 'that more than a third of the surface of the earth is taken up by this\\n', 'one ocean. Any thought of getting General Goethals to remedy this matter\\n', 'by filling up the Pacific is, moreover, hopeless, for all the land in\\n', \"the world, if spread over the Pacific's surface, would only make an\\n\", 'island surrounded by twenty million square miles of sea.\\n', '\\n', 'Feeling depressed over these facts I now began to look for points of\\n', 'merit; for we are told to try to find the good in everything, and though\\n', 'I fear I pay but scant attention to this canon when in my normal state\\n', 'ashore, at sea I become another man.\\n', '\\n', 'On land I have a childish feeling that the Creator has not time to pay\\n', 'attention to me, having so many other people to look after; but a ship\\n', 'far out at sea is a conspicuous object. I feel that it must catch His\\n', 'eye. I feel Him looking at me. And though I hope He likes me, I see no\\n', 'special reason why He should. I am so full of faults, so critical, so\\n', 'prejudiced. Consider, for instance, the way I used to go on about\\n', 'President Wilson and Josephus Daniels and W. J. Bryan. I am afraid that\\n', 'was very wrong in me. Instead of studying their failings I should have\\n', 'remedied my own. I should have given more to charity. I should have been\\n', 'more gentle in expressing my opinions. I should have written often to my\\n', 'sister, who so enjoys getting letters from me. I should have looked for\\n', 'good in everything.\\n', '\\n', 'Immediately I begin to run about the ship looking for it. And lo! I find\\n', 'it. The ship is comfortable. It seems to be designed to stay on top of\\n', 'the water. The table is beyond criticism. The passengers are\\n', 'interesting. The very vastness of this ocean tends to make them so.\\n', \"Instead of being all of a pattern, as would be one's fellow passengers\\n\", 'on an Atlantic liner, they are a heterogeneous lot, familiar with\\n', 'strange corners of the globe and full of curious tales and bits of\\n', 'information. Instead of talking always of hotels in London, Paris,\\n', 'Venice, Rome and Naples, they speak familiarly of Seoul, Shanghai,\\n', 'Peking, Hongkong, Saigon and Singapore. And amongst them are a few\\n', 'having intimate acquaintance with islands and cities so remote that\\n', 'their names sing in the ears like fantastic songs. Fragrant names. The\\n', 'Celebes and Samarkand!\\n', '\\n', 'There was a little Englishman who hunted butterflies for a museum. He\\n', 'told me of great spiders as big as your two hands, that build their webs\\n', 'between the trees in the jungles of Borneo--I think he said Borneo. But\\n', 'whatever the name of the place, he found there natives having tails from\\n', 'two to four inches long--I think he said two to four inches. But\\n', 'whatever the length of the tails, he had photographs to prove that tails\\n', \"there were. The latest theory of man's evolution, he told me, is not the\\n\", 'theory of Darwin, but holds that there existed long ago an intermediary\\n', 'creature between man and ape, from which both are derived--the ape\\n', 'having, I take it, evolved upward into the treetops, while man evolved\\n', 'downward--down, down, down, until at last came jazz and Lenine and\\n', 'Trotzky.\\n', '\\n', 'Another man had lived for years in Korea.

Equally important, clogs\\n', 'and shoes are left outside the door of the Japanese house in winter and\\n', 'summer, and as in the winter the house is often very cold, having no\\n', 'cellar and only small braziers, called _hibachi_, to give warmth, the\\n', 'covering afforded the feet by the skirts of a Japanese costume is very\\n', 'comforting. Moreover, the Japanese themselves declare that European\\n', 'dress is not becoming to their women, being neither suited to their\\n', 'figures nor to the little pigeon-toed shuffle which is so fetching\\n', 'beneath the skirts of a kimono.\\n', '\\n', 'What was the result of all this?\\n', '\\n', 'The men who found foreign dress useful continued to wear it for\\n', 'business, although those who could afford to do so kept a Japanese\\n', 'wardrobe as well. But the women, to whom European dress was only an\\n', 'encumbrance, discarded it completely, so that to-day no sight is rarer\\n', 'in Japan than that of a Japanese woman dressed in other than the native\\n', 'costume.\\n', '\\n', 'If a Japanese lady be cursed with atrocious taste, there is practically\\n', 'no way to find it out, no matter how much money she may spend on\\n', 'personal adornment. The worst that she may do is to carry her clothes\\n', 'less prettily than other women of her class. The lines she cannot\\n', 'change. The fabrics are prescribed.

She may have some pretty ornamental\\n', 'combs for her black lacquer hair, a bar pin for her _obi_, a watch, and\\n', 'perhaps, if she be very much Americanized, a ring and a mesh bag. A\\n', 'hairdresser she must have, both to accomplish that amazing and effective\\n', 'coif she wears, and to tell her all the latest gossip (for in Japan, as\\n', 'elsewhere, the hairdresser is famed as a medium for the transmission of\\n', 'spicy items which ought not to be transmitted); but her pocketbook is\\n', 'free from the assaults of milliners; hats she has none; only a draped\\n', 'hood when the cold weather comes.\\n', '\\n', 'The feminine costume is regulated by three things: first, by the age of\\n', 'the wearer; second, by the season; third, by the requirements of the\\n', 'occasion. The brightest colours are worn by children; the best kimonos\\n', 'of children of prosperous families are of silk in brilliant flowered\\n', 'patterns. Their pendant sleeves are very long.

On the exterior\\n', 'kimono the family crest--some emblem generally circular in form, such as\\n', 'a conventionalized flower or leaf design, about an inch in\\n', 'diameter--appears five times in white: on the breast at either side, on\\n', 'the back of either sleeve at a point near the elbow, and at the centre\\n', 'of the back, between the shoulder-blades. Because of these crests the\\n', 'goods from which the kimono is made have to be dyed to order, the crests\\n', 'being blocked out in wax on the original white silk so that the dye\\n', 'fails to penetrate. Even the under-kimonos of fashionable ladies will\\n', 'have crests made in this way.\\n', '\\n', 'With the kimono a Japanese lady always wears a neck-piece called an\\n', '_eri_ (pronounced \"airy\"), a long straight band revealed in a narrow\\n', 'V-shaped margin inside the neck of the inner kimono.

The average cost of a fine new obi is, I believe, about two\\n', 'hundred dollars, and I have heard of obi costing as much as a thousand\\n', 'dollars. Some of the less expensive ones are very pretty also, and many\\n', 'a poor woman will have as her chief treasure an obi worth forty or fifty\\n', 'dollars which she will wear only on great occasions, with her best silk\\n', 'kimono.\\n', '\\n', 'A Tokyo lady notable for the invariable loveliness of her costumes gives\\n', 'me the following information in response to an inquiry as to the cost of\\n', 'dressing.\\n', '\\n', '\"As our style never changes,\" she writes, \"we don\\'t have to buy new\\n', 'dresses every season, as our American sisters do.

Thus tea was first taken as a medicine\\n', '\"to regulate the five viscera and expel evil spirits.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Not long after this we find the drinking of tea becoming a pastime of\\n', 'the nobility, and by degrees we see the development of aesthetic\\n', 'practices in connection with it. Art objects were displayed when people\\n', 'met for tea; sumptuous tea-parties were given by _daimyos_, and one\\n', 'writer tells us that there came a period of decadence in the Feudal Era\\n', 'when warriors would lay down the sword in favour of the teapot, and die\\n', 'cup in hand when their castles were taken by their enemies.\\n', '\\n', '                   *       *       *       *       *\\n', '\\n', 'Let me digress here to speak briefly of the Feudal Era, the most\\n', 'interesting era of Japanese history. It lasted from the twelfth to the\\n', 'middle of the nineteenth century--that is, throughout the period during\\n', 'which Japan was ruled not by its Emperors, but by several successive\\n', 'families of shoguns, or as for reasons given later they were sometimes\\n', 'called, _tycoons_. Though the shoguns usurped Imperial power it is a\\n', 'noteworthy fact that they did not usurp the throne itself nor attempt to\\n', 'destroy the Imperial family, but were content to keep the successive\\n', 'emperors in a state of impotence. Under the shoguns were the daimyos,\\n', 'powerful feudal lords acting in effect as provincial governors; and each\\n', 'daimyo had his _samurai_, or fighting men, holding rank in several\\n', 'grades. There was also a class of samurai known as _ronin_ who\\n', 'acknowledged no lord as their master, but were independent fighters and\\n', 'trouble-makers. I give this outline because these various terms confused\\n', 'me at first. There was but one shogun at a time; the daimyos numbered\\n', 'between two and three hundred, and it has been estimated that there were\\n', 'some two million samurai. With a very few exceptions--among them rich\\n', 'farmers and swordmakers--no one below the rank of samurai could wear a\\n', 'sword. The sword-wearing class was the ruling class, and ordinary\\n', 'workers were regarded as of little consequence. A samurai could strike\\n', 'down with his sword any plebeian who jostled him by accident, or who as\\n', 'much as looked at him in a manner which he found distasteful.\\n', '\\n', 'The rank of samurai corresponded with that of knights in feudal Europe,\\n', 'and Japanese families who are descended from samurai are proud of the\\n', 'fact, precisely as some European families, and indeed some American\\n', 'families, are proud of having sprung from knightly forbears.\\n', '\\n', '                   *       *       *       *       *\\n', '\\n', 'But to return to our tea. A Zen priest named Shuko is said to have\\n', 'originated the idea of associating with the habit of tea-drinking the\\n', 'cultivation of \"the four virtues\"--urbanity, purity, courtesy, and\\n', 'imperturbability--and this conception, originating about the middle of\\n', 'the fifteenth century, is to this day a tradition of the Tea Ceremony,\\n', 'or _cha-no-yu_.\\n', '\\n', 'The great soldiers Nobunaga and Hideyoshi, chief figures of the latter\\n', 'half of the sixteenth century, were addicts of the Tea Ceremony. It was\\n', 'Hideyoshi who caused the Tea Master, Sen-no-Rikyu, to consider the\\n', 'various schools of Ceremonial Tea which had developed, and codify them.\\n', '\\n', 'The keynote of the ceremony prescribed by Sen-no-Rikyu was \"simplicity\"\\n', 'of a most elaborate kind. There must be a special teahouse in the\\n', 'garden--though in recent times a special tearoom in the house is\\n', 'considered adequate. The teahouse was required to be small. Its exact\\n', 'dimensions were given, down even to the height of the doorway, which was\\n', 'so low as to compel guests to enter with bowed heads. The house must be\\n', 'simple in the extreme, yet built of the choicest woods. The character of\\n', 'the tea equipment was specified, as was the nature of the decorations.\\n', '\\n', 'This was where Flower Arrangement originally came in. A _kakemono_--one\\n', 'of those Oriental paintings mounted on a vertical panel of silk arranged\\n', 'to roll up on a cylindrical piece of wood and ivory attached to its\\n', 'lower margin--must hang in the shallow alcove which is the place of\\n', 'honour in every Japanese room; and beneath the kakemono must be\\n', 'displayed an object of art or an arrangement of flowers having a certain\\n', 'relationship to the painting.\\n', '\\n', 'For example, if the painting be that of a lion the suitable flower to be\\n', 'displayed beneath it is the peony, because the lion is the king of\\n', 'beasts and the peony the king of flowers. This is merely one simple\\n', 'instance of an artistic association of ideas, infinite in number and\\n', 'sometimes complicated in character. Yet these decorative affinities are\\n', 'understood not only by the highly educated Japanese, but by a large\\n', 'proportion of the people--for the feeling for art is, I believe,\\n', 'distributed more widely amongst the people of Japan than amongst those\\n', 'of any other nation. The Japanese do not jam their homes with furniture\\n', 'and decorations as we so often do, but exhibit their art treasures a few\\n', 'at a time, keeping most of them put away. It is said that Japanese rooms\\n', 'look bare to the average foreigner. To me, however, their rooms do not\\n', 'look bare, but have an air of exquisite refinement seldom found in an\\n', 'American or English room.\\n', '\\n', 'Some Americans who have learned to appreciate the Japanese idea of\\n', 'decoration, and who imitate it superficially, nevertheless achieve\\n', 'assemblages of art objects which, because of the lack of relationship\\n', 'between them, offend the trained Japanese eye precisely as a discord\\n', 'offends a trained musical ear.

Lately there has\\n', 'been some agitation in Japan for what is called \"universal suffrage,\"\\n', 'but it must not be supposed that by that term woman suffrage is meant.\\n', 'The proposal involves only the extension of the ballot to all males, as\\n', 'against the present system which requires that a man shall pay taxes\\n', 'above a certain amount in order to have a vote. Woman suffrage is not\\n', 'even in sight. When I was in Japan a few progressive women were asking,\\n', 'not for the vote, but for the abrogation of the rule which denied their\\n', 'sex the right to attend political meetings. They were successful. The\\n', 'rule was recently abrogated. A movement had also been started by some\\n', 'advanced women led by Mrs. Raicho Hiratsuka, for laws compelling men who\\n', 'wish to marry to obtain medical certificates declaring them mentally\\n', 'sound and free from diseases of a kind likely to be communicated to a\\n', 'wife. I heard that seventy out of three hundred girls employed by the\\n', 'railway administration in Kyoto had organized an association to aid in\\n', 'the advancement of the measures proposed, vowing never to marry unless\\n', 'their would-be husbands complied with the requirements for which Mrs.\\n', 'Raicho Hiratsuka and her associates were endeavouring to obtain legal\\n', 'recognition.\\n', '\\n', 'Another matter that wants mending is the legal status of married women.\\n', 'So far as I know there has been made no serious effort to improve the\\n', 'present situation. Under Japanese law a woman, upon contracting\\n', 'marriage, is debarred from civil rights, having practically the standing\\n', 'of a minor. A wife cannot transfer her own real estate, bring an action\\n', 'at law, or even accept or reject a legacy or a gift, without the consent\\n', 'of her husband. Laws not dissimilar to these exist, I believe, in some\\n', 'of the more backward states of our own Union. According to the law of\\n', 'Japan a widow cannot succeed her husband as head of the family if she\\n', 'has a child who can take the succession. In matters of inheritance an\\n', 'elder sister gives place to a younger son, even to an illegitimate son\\n', 'recognized by the father.\\n', '\\n', 'A husband may divorce a wife for adultery, but a wife cannot divorce a\\n', 'husband for this cause--or rather, she can do so only when he has\\n', 'offended with a married woman whose husband has therefore brought action\\n', 'for divorce. Thus it will be seen that a husband may even take a\\n', 'concubine to live in his home, along with his wife and children, without\\n', 'giving ground for divorce. Concubinage, I am told, is still to some\\n', 'extent practised in Japan, though popular opinion is against it. In one\\n', 'respect, however, the Japanese divorce laws are more enlightened than\\n', 'our own. A husband and a wife who agree in desiring a divorce may easily\\n', 'obtain it by stating the fact to the court.\\n', '\\n', 'Somehow or other I came to the subject of divorce before that of\\n', 'marriage. The Orient and the Occident are nowhere farther apart than in\\n', 'their views and customs as to the mating of men and women. In Japan\\n', 'marriages for love rarely occur, though it is said that the tendency of\\n', 'young people to marry to suit themselves is growing. Young Japanese\\n', 'girls, I am told, often look with envy upon women of other nations,\\n', 'where marriage for love is the general rule. Probably they suppose that\\n', 'such matches are invariably happy; that the love is always real love,\\n', 'and that it endures for ever. No doubt our system, viewed from afar,\\n', 'looks as rosy to a Japanese girl as their system looks appalling to an\\n', 'American girl. Yet each has certain merits.

He called with his automobile and took me to the amphitheatre.\\n', '\\n', '\"Our mode of wrestling is not at all like yours,\" he said, \"and I want\\n', 'to explain it to you.\"\\n', '\\n', 'It was about eleven in the morning when, after traversing several\\n', 'streets strung with rows of Japanese lanterns, and filled with hurrying\\n', 'throngs, we reached the great circular concrete building into which an\\n', 'eager crowd was pouring through many portals--an audience which, though\\n', 'made up for the most part of men, contained not a few women and some\\n', 'children. Many, though by no means all of the women were geisha, for\\n', 'wrestlers have about the same rank as geisha in the social scale, and\\n', 'they are often the heroes as well as the intimates of the fair\\n', 'entertainers.\\n', '\\n', 'As we approached the amphitheatre the thought came to me that there is a\\n', 'curious sameness in the atmosphere surrounding great sporting events the\\n', 'world over, however little the various sports themselves may resemble\\n', 'one another. To approach this great building in Tokyo during wrestling\\n', 'week is quite like approaching the Plaza de Toros in Madrid, or the\\n', 'building in which _jai alai_ is played in Havana, or the Polo Grounds in\\n', 'New York, or the Yale Bowl, or the Harvard Stadium.\\n', '\\n', 'The Kokugikwan is a circular building roofed with glass and seating\\n', 'fourteen or fifteen thousand persons. At the centre is a mound of earth\\n', 'with a flat top on which the ring is marked with a border of woven\\n', 'straw. Over the ring is a kiosk supported by four heavy posts which are\\n', 'respectively red, green, black, and white in colour, and are considered\\n', 'to symbolize the four corners of the earth. The kiosk has a roof\\n', 'somewhat resembling that of a temple and is embellished with curtains of\\n', 'purple-and-white silk which hang down a few feet below the eaves.\\n', '\\n', 'The main floor of the amphitheatre is banked up toward the back. The\\n', 'seats at the ringside are reserved for the participant wrestlers; behind\\n', 'these are some tiers of chairs which are presumably occupied by the most\\n', 'frantic fans, and behind the chairs comes a great area of boxes, each\\n', 'seating from four to six persons. These boxes, like those of a typical\\n', 'Japanese theatre, do not contain chairs, but are floored with thick\\n', 'straw mats on which are cushions for the occupants to squat on. The only\\n', 'division between the boxes is a railing about a foot high. Above the\\n', 'main floor are two galleries running all the way around the building.\\n', 'The Imperial box is in the first gallery. People in the galleries sit in\\n', 'chairs, in front of which are narrow shelf-like tables from which\\n', 'luncheon may be eaten--for wrestling matches, like the old-style\\n', 'theatrical performances, last practically all day.\\n', '\\n', 'During the first part of the morning, bouts between numerous minor\\n', 'wrestlers are run off, but at about eleven the building fills up, for\\n', 'everyone wishes to see the two groups of champions march in. One group\\n', 'represents East Japan, the other West Japan; each group contains about\\n', 'twenty men, and their seats are at the eastern and western sides of the\\n', 'ring, respectively. This representation of East and West is not literal,\\n', 'but is the traditional division. A man from an Eastern province may be\\n', 'champion of the West, and vice versa.\\n', '\\n', 'Gross-looking creatures, naked to the waist, they enter in single file,\\n', 'each wearing a long velvet apron, elaborately embroidered and tasselled.\\n', 'These aprons, which are given to them by their patrons, are removed\\n', 'before the contests, a loin-cloth and short skirt of fringe being worn\\n', 'beneath them.\\n', '\\n', 'Marching into the ring the champions form a circle and go through a\\n', 'series of set exercises, clapping their hands in unison, raising their\\n', 'legs high and stamping their feet violently upon the ground to exhibit\\n', 'their muscular flexibility. After these exercises they march out again.\\n', '\\n', 'Next enter the supreme champions of the Eastern group and of the Western\\n', 'group--the two great wrestlers of Japan--popular idols who, by reason of\\n', 'having remained undefeated throughout three or more successive wrestling\\n', 'meets, are entitled to wear not only the elaborate velvet apron, but a\\n', 'very thick white rope wound several times about their waists and knotted\\n', 'in a certain way.\\n', '\\n', 'Each of these super-champions is attended on his march to the ring by\\n', 'two other wrestlers. The one who precedes him is known as the _tsuyu\\n', 'harai_, or dew-brusher. In theory, he clears the way, brushing dew from\\n', 'imaginary grass before the feet of the mighty one. The attendant who\\n', 'brings up the rear is the _tachi mochi_, or sword-bearer; for according\\n', 'to old Japanese custom no wrestler except a super-champion was allowed\\n', 'to wear a sword, and though the sword is now only a symbol, the custom\\n', 'still survives, and the sword of the super-champion must be carried in\\n', 'behind him.\\n', '\\n', 'To one accustomed to the sort of wrestling practised in the Western\\n', 'world, many of these champions do not look like athletes, since they\\n', 'are, as a rule, so fat that their paunches bulge like balconies over the\\n', 'tops of their aprons and loin cloths, and their arms and thighs tremble\\n', 'like jelly when they walk. Under the Japanese method of wrestling,\\n', 'however, each match is quickly settled, wherefore endurance is not so\\n', 'important as great weight and power in the first moment of attack. It is\\n', 'for this reason that fat wrestlers are usually the most successful. Some\\n', 'of them have weighed as much as three hundred and fifty pounds. But now\\n', 'and then there comes along a super-champion like Tachiyama, who is not\\n', 'very fat, and who conquers by strength, speed, and reach rather than by\\n', 'mere weight.\\n', '\\n', 'When the super-champions have exhibited themselves, the two groups of\\n', 'lesser champions return and occupy their seats around the ring. The four\\n', 'referees--retired wrestlers--take seats on cushions, one at each corner\\n', 'of the kiosk, and the umpire, wearing beautiful flowing silks and a\\n', 'strange little pointed hat like that of a Buddhist priest, enters the\\n', 'ring and, holding up the lacquered wooden fan, which is his badge of\\n', 'office, announces in impressive tones the names of the two men who are\\n', 'about to meet.\\n', '\\n', 'The adversaries then enter the ring and go through the same old series\\n', 'of stampings and flexings. Each takes a handful of salt from a box at\\n', 'his side of the ring, puts a little in his mouth and throws the rest\\n', 'upon the ground before him. This is supposed to have a purifying effect,\\n', 'not in the antiseptic sense, but in some occult way. Salt is often used\\n', 'thus in Japan.\\n', '\\n', 'Having completed these preliminaries the two men take their positions\\n', 'facing each other, braced upon all fours. But this apparent readiness by\\n', 'no means indicates that the contest is commencing. Instead of\\n', 'immediately attacking, they will often remain thus poised for minutes,\\n', 'sharply watching each other. Then one of them will get up and take a\\n', 'drink, or will go for some more salt and throw it in the ring. Also one\\n', 'or the other will often make a false start, attacking when his adversary\\n', 'is not ready to accept combat; whereafter the two resume their crouching\\n', 'attitudes, toes braced, hands on the ground. This sort of thing may\\n', 'continue for ten or twenty minutes, to the accompaniment of howls from\\n', 'the fans, who shout the names of their favourites and bellow Japanese\\n', 'equivalents for such Americanisms as \"Go to it!\" and \"Atta Boy!\"\\n', '\\n', 'But whereas the period of preparation may often be measured in fractions\\n', 'of an hour, the actual struggle usually consumes but a few seconds. The\\n', 'men spring at each other like a pair of savage fighting dogs and the\\n', 'contest is settled before you know it. There is none of that straining\\n', 'to get a certain hold, or to break one, which is so characteristic of\\n', 'our style of wrestling, and you never see the contestants writhing in\\n', 'deadly embrace upon the floor. The vanquished need not necessarily be\\n', 'thrown at all, though often he is. If any portion of his body, other\\n', 'than the soles of his feet, touches the ground, or if (whether he be\\n', 'thrown or not) any portion of his body touches the ground outside the\\n', 'ring, that means defeat. In case both men fall, or are forced from the\\n', 'ring together, the one who first makes contact with the ground, or first\\n', 'leaves the ring, is vanquished.\\n', '\\n', 'Often a man is beaten by being bent over until he is forced to support\\n', 'himself on one hand, and there have been cases in which decisions were\\n', \"rendered merely because one man's head was bent down until his top-knot\\n\", 'touched the floor. A wrestler will sometimes win in one hard push,\\n', 'backing his opponent out of the ring; but in this there is always the\\n', 'danger that the one being pushed will at the last moment step aside,\\n', \"causing the adversary's own momentum to carry him beyond the boundary,\\n\", 'thus applying an underlying principle of _jiu-jutsu_,--or _jiudo_, as it\\n', \"is called in its improved form--in which a man's own strength is used to\\n\", 'defeat him. Frequently, however, there will be a spectacular throw; and\\n', 'sometimes, when this occurs, the ringside seats, so coveted at wrestling\\n', 'and boxing matches in this country, are not highly desirable. I have\\n', 'seen huge wrestlers hurled through the air to land sprawling on their\\n', 'comrades in their seats.\\n', '\\n', 'When a close decision has to be made the umpire confers with the\\n', 'referees, and at such times the audience and the two opposing groups of\\n', 'wrestlers are vociferous in support of the contestant they favour.\\n', '\\n', 'To the credit of the Japanese be it said, however, that they do not\\n', 'yell: \"Kill the umpire!\" when displeased by a decision rendered in\\n', 'connection with their national sport; that they do not throw bottles at\\n', 'the umpire, and that it never becomes necessary to give police\\n', 'protection to an umpire whose judgment has not accorded with that of the\\n', 'crowd. The Japanese, you see, have not adopted every detail of Western\\n', 'civilization.\\n', '\\n', 'I must have seen twenty-five or thirty bouts that day. But though I was\\n', 'interested I cannot pretend to find in Japanese wrestling the qualities\\n', 'of a really great sport. Skill their wrestlers have, but there is no\\n', 'call for stamina. Their style of wrestling seems to me to let off where\\n', 'ours begins.\\n', '\\n', 'Japanese life runs at lower pressure than our life. There is not the\\n', 'nervous rush about it. Matters move at a more comfortable pace, and\\n', 'people seem to have more patience. An American crowd would become\\n', 'restless over the interminable preliminaries of each Japanese wrestling\\n', 'bout, and would find the bout itself unsatisfactory because of its\\n', 'brevity and the lack of sustained effort. The Japanese, on the other\\n', 'hand, seem always to be willing to wait for something to happen. One\\n', 'notices this in innumerable ways.

There was no\\n', 'regular day of rest. One day a month was usually appointed as a holiday\\n', 'for commercial and industrial workers; later it became two days a month;\\n', 'and at last there developed a custom of making those days the first and\\n', 'third Sundays of the month.

The Japanese have\\n', 'also taken up whisky-drinking to some extent. They import Scotch whisky\\n', 'and also make a bad imitation Scotch whisky of their own.

A geisha house is in fact simply a house in which geisha live\\n', 'under the charge of the master or mistress to whom they are bound by\\n', 'contract or indenture. Geisha are booked through exchanges and meet\\n', 'their patrons at restaurants or teahouses. When not on duty they are\\n', 'private citizens, and it would be considered the height of vulgarity for\\n', 'a man to call upon a geisha at the geisha house, however innocent the\\n', 'purpose of his call.\\n', '\\n', 'A further reason for the erroneous idea of what a geisha is, lies in the\\n', 'fact that Western civilization has no equivalent class. Geisha\\n', 'correspond more nearly to cabaret entertainers than to any other class\\n', 'we have, yet even here there is no real parallel. It is not customary in\\n', 'Japan--except in foreign-style hotels--to dine in public. If a man be\\n', 'alone in a hotel he dines by himself in his room, save that the little\\n', 'nesans who serve him will try to make themselves agreeable and that the\\n', 'proprietor may do the same. Or if a man gives a luncheon or a dinner\\n', 'party at a restaurant he will have a private room. Therefore, under the\\n', 'Japanese system, there is never a general assemblage of persons,\\n', 'strangers to one another, who may be entertained as a body while they\\n', 'are dining. Thus the geisha is a private entertainer, and in order that\\n', 'the most desirable geisha may be secured it is customary to make\\n', 'arrangements for a luncheon or dinner several days in advance. This is\\n', 'usually done through the proprietor of the restaurant, who is told the\\n', 'names of the geisha the host desires to summon, and who notifies them\\n', 'through the local geisha exchange.\\n', '\\n', 'Men who frequently lunch and dine out naturally become acquainted with\\n', 'many geisha, and have their preferences; and if a host knows that one of\\n', 'his guests particularly likes a certain geisha he will generally try to\\n', 'arrange to have her at his party.\\n', '\\n', 'There are three classes of geisha. Those of the best class frequently\\n', 'have good incomes. They are often given large presents by their wealthy\\n', 'patrons, and many of them are the mistresses of men of means, who\\n', 'sometimes take them off on week-end outings and spend a great deal of\\n', 'money on them.\\n', '\\n', 'However this may be, a geisha of the first class is a creature of\\n', 'exquisite refinement of manner, and there is about her not the faintest\\n', 'suggestion of coarseness. She will be friendly, even pleasantly\\n', 'familiar, but never, in public, is she guilty of the slightest\\n', 'impropriety. I have been to many gay parties in Japan, but I have never\\n', 'seen a geisha or her patron behave in a way that would shock the most\\n', 'fastidious American lady. Naturally the situation is somewhat different\\n', 'among low-class Japanese and the geisha they patronize. There are vulgar\\n', 'geisha to entertain vulgar men. But even a low-class geisha, if sent for\\n', 'in an emergency to entertain a man of taste, will often be sufficiently\\n', 'clever to adjust herself to the situation.\\n', '\\n', 'During the meal the geisha will sit before or beside the gentleman she\\n', 'is designated to entertain, chatting with him, amusing him and serving\\n', 'him with saké. Afterward she will join the other geisha in giving an\\n', 'entertainment, the part she takes in this depending upon her special\\n', 'talent, which may be for singing, playing, or dancing. Pretty young\\n', 'geisha are most often dancers, while those who are older are generally\\n', 'musicians. Also there are some geisha who are merely bright and pleasing\\n', 'and who succeed without other accomplishments. The host, making up a\\n', 'party, selects his geisha with these various requirements in mind, so\\n', 'that his whole company of geisha will be well balanced.\\n', '\\n', 'Foreigners are generally most taken with the little dancing girls, or\\n', 'maiko, who are mere children, and who with their sweet, bright, happy\\n', 'little faces, and their bewitchingly brilliant flowered-silk costumes,\\n', 'are altogether fascinating.

One of these dances represented\\n', 'clam-digging. In it the dancers held small trays which in pantomime they\\n', 'used as shovels, going through the motion of digging the clams out of\\n', 'the sand and throwing them into a basket. The dance was accompanied by a\\n', 'song, as was also another folk dance in which two of the maiko enacted\\n', 'the rôles of lovers who were obliged to part because the mother of the\\n', 'girl was forcing her to marry a rich man.

That is the gesture for a man. When a woman weeps\\n', 'she holds her sleeve-tab before her eyes, for it is a tradition that\\n', 'women dry their tears with their sleeves.

This, I think, is because they generally\\n', 'have a sense of form, and as geisha dancing is a sort of animated\\n', '_tableau vivant_, a sense of form is the one thing most essential to an\\n', 'appreciation of it.\\n', '\\n', 'Indeed I will go further and proclaim my belief that, to a visitor who\\n', 'would really understand Japan, a sense of form is a vital necessity.\\n', '\\n', 'Japan is all form.

Once I asked a Tokyo geisha to give a dance of\\n', 'which I had heard, but she replied with something like a shrug that the\\n', 'dance in question was given by the Yokohama geisha, wherefore, she and\\n', 'her associates did not perform it.\\n', '\\n', 'So far as I know there is not to be seen in Tokyo or Yokohama any large\\n', 'geisha show, resembling a theatrical entertainment, such as one may see\\n', 'in Kyoto in cherry-blossom season, or at the Embujo Theatre in Osaka\\n', 'every May. These exhibitions are delightful things to see, the Cherry\\n', 'Dance of Kyoto, in particular, being famous throughout Japan. The\\n', 'buildings in which they are held are impressive. The one in Kyoto was\\n', 'built especially for the Cherry Dance, and the interior of it, while in\\n', 'a general way like a large theatre, is modelled after the style of an\\n', 'old Japanese palace. The geisha dancers and musicians are splendidly\\n', 'trained and the costumes are magnificent.\\n', '\\n', 'Rapid changes of scene are made in these theatres by means unfamiliar to\\n', 'American theatre-goers. As in our playhouses, flies and drops are\\n', 'sometimes hoisted upward when a scene is being changed, but quite as\\n', 'frequently they sink down through slots in the stage floor. Also, in the\\n', 'dimness of a \"dark change\" one sees whole settings going through\\n', 'extraordinary contortions, folding up in ways unknown in our theatres,\\n', 'or turning inside-out, or upside-down. One feels that their stage is\\n', 'generally equipped with less perfect mechanical and lighting devices\\n', 'than ours, but that a great deal of ingenuity is shown in the actual\\n', 'building of scenery. One of the most astonishing things I ever saw in\\n', 'any theatre was the sudden disappearance of a back-drop at the Embujo in\\n', 'Osaka. The bottom of this drop began all at once to contract; then the\\n', 'whole funnel-shaped mass shot down through a small aperture in the\\n', 'floor, like a silk handkerchief passing swiftly through a ring.\\n', '\\n', 'The most perfect illusion of depth and distance I ever saw on a stage\\n', 'was in one scene of the Kyoto Cherry Dance. From the front of the house\\n', 'the scene appeared to go back and back incredibly. Nor could I make out\\n', 'where the back-drop met the stage, so skilfully was the painted picture\\n', 'blended with the built-up scenery. When the performance was over I\\n', 'inspected this setting and found that the scenic artist had achieved his\\n', 'result by a most elaborately complete contraction of the lines of\\n', 'perspective, not only in the painted scenery but in objects on the\\n', 'stage. A row of tables running from the footlights to the rear of the\\n', 'stage had been built in diminishing scale, and rows of Japanese\\n', 'lanterns, apparently exactly alike, became in reality smaller and\\n', 'smaller as they reached back from the proscenium, so that the whole\\n', 'perspective was exaggerated. The stage of this theatre was not in fact\\n', 'so deep as that of the New York Hippodrome or the Century Theatre.\\n', '\\n', 'At the geisha dance in Osaka I asked what pay the hundred or more geisha\\n', 'musicians and dancers received, and was told that they are not paid at\\n', 'all. There are two reasons for this. First, it is regarded as the duty\\n', 'of all geisha to celebrate the spring with music and dancing; and\\n', 'second, they consider it an honour to be selected for these festivals,\\n', 'since only the most skilful members of their sisterhood are chosen.\\n', '\\n', 'Geisha, you see, are not entirely mercenary. When two or three of them\\n', 'go off for a little outing together, or when they shop, they spend money\\n', 'freely; and there are stories of geisha who pay their own fees in order\\n', 'to meet their impecunious lovers at teahouses.\\n', '\\n', 'In Japanese romances the geisha is a favourite figure. A popular theme\\n', 'for stories concerning her is that of her love affair with a student\\n', 'whose family disown him because of his infatuation. The geisha\\n', 'sweetheart then supports him while he completes his education. He\\n', 'graduates brilliantly, securing an important appointment under the\\n', \"government, and rewards the girl's devotion by making her his bride. Or\\n\", 'if the story be tragic--and the Japanese have a strong taste for\\n', \"tragedy--the student's family is endeavouring to force him into a\\n\", 'brilliant match, wherefore the self-sacrificing geisha, whom he really\\n', 'loves, takes her own life, so that she may not stand in the way of his\\n', 'success.\\n', '\\n', 'There was a time a generation or two ago when Japanese aristocrats\\n', 'occasionally took geisha for their wives, much as young English noblemen\\n', 'used to marry chorus girls. But those things have changed in Japan and\\n', 'it is a long time since a man of position has made such a match. The\\n', 'plain truth is that, however justly or unjustly, the geisha class is not\\n', 'respected. They are victims of the curious law which operates the world\\n', 'over to make us always a little bit contemptuous of those whose\\n', 'occupation it is to amuse us. Moreover, geisha are not as a rule highly\\n', 'educated, and it is said that this fact makes it difficult for them to\\n', 'adjust themselves to an elevated place in the social scale.\\n', '\\n', 'Thus it comes about that, when geisha marry, their husbands are as a\\n', 'rule business men or merchants on a modest scale.\\n', '\\n', 'Yuki our treasured maid, had a friend who became a geisha, but who\\n', 'retired from the profession through the matrimonial portal.\\n', '\\n', '\"She smart girl,\" said Yuki. \"She too head to be geisha.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Why did she become one, then?\" I asked.\\n', '\\n', '\"Her family have great trouble. Her father need fifteen hundred yen\\n', 'right off. Must have. So she be geisha. But after while she meet rich\\n', \"man in teahouse, and he pay for her, so she don't have to be geisha any\\n\", 'more, and they get married.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Some excellent people I met in Japan--Americans imbued with the spirit\\n', 'of reform--objected strongly to the geisha system, contending that it is\\n', 'a barrier to happy domesticity. They felt that so long as there are\\n', 'geisha in Japan the average Japanese husband will have them at his\\n', 'parties, and will continue his present practice of leaving his wife at\\n', 'home when he goes out for a good time. I suppose this is true.\\n', 'Undoubtedly, to the Japanese wife, the geisha is the \"other woman.\" And\\n', 'as is so often the case with the \"other woman,\" in whatever land you\\n', 'find her, the geisha has certain strategic advantages over the wife.\\n', 'Like good wives everywhere, the Japanese wife is concerned with humdrum\\n', 'things--the children, housekeeping, the family finances--the things\\n', 'which often irritate and bore a husband if harped upon. But the\\n', 'circumstances in which a husband meets a geisha are genial and gay. Her\\n', 'business is to make him forget his cares and enjoy himself.\\n', '\\n', 'The expense of the geisha system is also urged against it. To dine at a\\n', 'first-class teahouse, with geisha, costs as much as, or more than, to\\n', 'dine elaborately at the most expensive New York hotels. It is well for\\n', 'strangers in Japan to understand this, since they often jump to the\\n', 'conclusion that the Japanese teahouse, which looks so simple--so\\n', 'delightfully simple!--by comparison with the gold and marble grandeur of\\n', 'a great American hotel dining room, must necessarily be cheaper. I\\n', 'remember a case in which some Americans, newly arrived in Tokyo, were\\n', 'entertained in the native manner by a Japanese gentleman, and felt that\\n', 'they were returning the courtesy in royal style when they invited him to\\n', 'dine with them at their hotel. Yet in point of fact their hotel\\n', 'dinner-party cost less than half as much per plate as his Japanese\\n', 'dinner had cost. While one does not value courtesy by what it costs, it\\n', 'is important not to undervalue it on any basis whatsoever.\\n', '\\n', 'There is, of course, a great variation in the cost of meals in teahouses\\n', 'and restaurants, and the fact that those which are inexpensive look\\n', 'exactly like those which are expensive helps to confuse the stranger. A\\n', 'great deal may be saved if one does without geisha. Also there are very\\n', 'agreeable restaurants in which the guest may cook his own food in a pan\\n', 'over a brazier which is brought into the dining room.\\n', '\\n', 'This chafing-dish style of cooking is said to have been introduced by a\\n', 'missionary who became tired of Japanese food and formed the habit of\\n', 'preparing his own meals as he travelled about. Now, however, it has come\\n', 'to be considered typically Japanese.\\n', '\\n', 'There are two names for cooking in this simple fashion. The word\\n', '_torinabe_ is derived from _tori_, a bird, and _nabe_, a pot or kettle;\\n', 'and _gyunabe_ from a combination of the word for a pot with _gyu_, which\\n', 'means a cow, or beef. The Suyehiro restaurants, having three branches in\\n', 'Tokyo, are famous for _torinabe_, as well as for an affectation of\\n', 'elegant simplicity and crudity in chinaware.

I wouldn\\'t say such a\\n', 'thing. It is always better in such cases to quote some one else. But I\\n', 'will say this much: If I were a reformer I should begin work at\\n', 'home--not in Japan. I should join the great movement, already so well\\n', 'started, for making the United States the purest and dullest country in\\n', 'the world. I should work with those who are attempting to accomplish\\n', 'this result entirely by legislation. But instead of trying, as they are\\n', 'now trying, to bring about the desired end by means of quantities of\\n', 'little pious laws covering quantities of little impious subjects, I\\n', 'should work for a blanket law covering everything--one great, sweeping\\n', 'law requiring all American citizens to be absolutely pure and good, not\\n', 'only in action but in thought. I assume that, if such a law were passed,\\n', 'everybody would abide by it, but in order to make it easier for them to\\n', 'do so I should abolish restaurants, theatres, motion pictures, dancing,\\n', 'baseball, talking-machines, art, literature, tobacco, candy, and\\n', 'soda-water. I should put dictographs in every home and have the police\\n', 'listen in on all conversations. Light-heartedness I should make a\\n', 'misdemeanor, and frivolity a crime.\\n', '\\n', 'Then, when our whole country had reached a state of perfection that was\\n', 'absolutely morbid, I should consider my work here done, and should move\\n', 'to Japan. But I should not stop being a reformer. Assuredly no! I should\\n', 'start at once to improve things over there. Take for instance this\\n', 'report that one sixth of all the money spent goes to geisha and such\\n', 'things. I should try first of all to remedy that situation. One sixth of\\n', 'the national expenditure represents a vast amount of money. Think of its\\n', \"being spent on good times! Such a lot of money! Still it isn't quite\\n\", 'enough. A quarter or a third would be better than a sixth. It would make\\n', 'things perfect. Not being a Japanese wife, I should advocate that.\\n', '\\n', 'I see but one serious objection to this plan. Should Japan become any\\n', 'more attractive than it now is, the Japanese might feel forced to pass\\n', 'exclusion laws. If they were to do so I hope they would not discriminate\\n', 'against people of any one race. I hope they would bar out everybody--not\\n', 'Americans alone. Because if they were to bar us out and at the same time\\n', 'allow the riffraff of Europe to come in, that might hurt our feelings.\\n', \"It isn't so hard to hurt our feelings, either.

First we went to a teahouse of\\n', 'the Yoshiwara, and I was readily able to perceive that the geisha in\\n', 'this teahouse were of a lower grade than those I had hitherto seen.\\n', 'Their faces were less intelligent, and they lacked the perfect grace and\\n', 'charm of their more successful sisters.\\n', '\\n', 'From the sounds about us it was apparent that a Yoshiwara teahouse is a\\n', 'place for drinking and more or less wild merrymaking.\\n', '\\n', 'Proceeding down the street from this teahouse we passed through orderly\\n', \"crowds and presently came to the district's most elaborate\\n\", 'establishment. It was a large three-story building of white glazed\\n', 'brick, with an inner courtyard containing a pretty garden. To enter this\\n', 'place was like entering a very fine Japanese hotel.\\n', '\\n', 'In the corridor hung a row of lacquered sticks each bearing a number in\\n', 'the Chinese character. There were, I think, about thirty of these\\n', 'sticks, and each represented a shogi. The number-one shogi was the most\\n', 'sought-after; number two ranked next, and so on. We were shown by the\\n', 'proprietress and some maids to a large matted room on the second floor,\\n', 'where saké, cakes and fruit were served to us. Then there appeared three\\n', 'geisha of a most unusual kind. They were women fifty-five or sixty years\\n', 'of age, rather large, with faces genial, amusing, and respectable. These\\n', 'I was told were geisha with a great local reputation for boisterous wit.\\n', 'My Japanese friends were thereafter kept in a continual state of mirth,\\n', 'and though I could not understand what the old geisha were saying, their\\n', 'droll manner was so infectious that I, too, was amused. Presently they\\n', 'were joined by a man with the face of a comedian. He was described to me\\n', 'as a \"male geisha.\" That is, he was an entertainer. He sang, told comic\\n', 'stories and showed real ability as a mimic.\\n', '\\n', 'This entertainment lasted for the better part of an hour. Then the\\n', 'mistress of the house came in with the air of one having something\\n', 'important to reveal. At a word from her the entertainers drew back and\\n', 'seated themselves on cushions at one side of the room. There was an\\n', 'impressive silence. Slowly, a sliding screen door of black lacquer and\\n', 'gold paper slipped back, moved by an unseen hand. We watched the open\\n', 'doorway.\\n', '\\n', 'Presently appeared the figure of a woman. She did not look in our\\n', 'direction, but moved out into the room as if it had been a stage and she\\n', 'an actress. Her step was slow and stately, and she was arrayed in a\\n', 'brilliant robe of red satin, heavily quilted, and embroidered with large\\n', 'elaborate designs. This was the number-one shogi. Her costume and\\n', 'bearing were magnificent, but her face was expressionless and not at all\\n', 'beautiful.\\n', '\\n', 'When she was well within the room the number-two shogi, dressed in the\\n', 'same style, moved in behind her, and followed with the same stately\\n', 'tread. In procession they walked across the room, turned slowly, trailed\\n', 'the hems of their wadded kimonos back across the matting, and made an\\n', 'exit by the door at which they had entered. Then the door slipped shut.\\n', '\\n', 'The chatter began once more, but after a few minutes we were again\\n', 'silenced. For the second time the door opened and the two women\\n', 'appeared. They were now arrayed in purple kimonos, quilted and\\n', 'embroidered like the first. Again they made a dignified progress across\\n', 'the room and back; again they disappeared.\\n', '\\n', 'That was the end of the inspection. By now we should, in theory, have\\n', 'been entranced with one or the other of the shogi we had seen. It was\\n', 'time to go. But as the Japanese gentleman whom I had asked to bring me\\n', 'to this place was a man of consequence, an especial courtesy was shown\\n', 'us ere we departed. In ordinary circumstances we should not have seen\\n', 'the two women again, but now they unbent so far as to come in and kneel\\n', 'upon the floor beside us--for we had checked our shoes at the entrance,\\n', 'and were seated Japanese-fashion upon silk cushions.\\n', '\\n', 'My Japanese friends attempted to chat with the shogi, but evidently the\\n', 'latter did not shine in the arts of conversation. The talk was grave and\\n', 'unmistakably perfunctory, and after a little while the two arose, bowed\\n', 'profoundly, with a sort of grandeur, and trailed their wondrous robes\\n', 'out of the room. It was like seeing in the life a pair of courtesans\\n', 'from a colour-print by Utamaro. As they went I wondered whether, in the\\n', 'beginning, they had striven to be geisha instead of shogi, but had been\\n', 'forced to the Yoshiwara by reason of their lack of talent for music and\\n', 'conversation.\\n', '\\n', 'Before we left I was shown some of the other rooms of this huge house,\\n', 'including those of several of the women. The woodwork was like light\\n', 'brown satin and the matting glistened almost as though it were\\n', 'lacquered. There were some kakemono and fine painted screens with\\n', \"old-gold backgrounds, and in the women's rooms were cabinets and\\n\", 'dressing-stands lacquered red and gold. The dressing-stands were of a\\n', 'height to suit one squatting on the floor. It was as though the top\\n', 'section of one of our dressing tables were set upon the floor--a mirror\\n', 'with small drawers at either side.\\n', '\\n', 'The mistress and her maids accompanied us to the street door when we\\n', 'departed. They made profound obeisances, and the mistress declared her\\n', 'appreciation of the great honour we had paid her by visiting her\\n', 'establishment. My Japanese friends replied in kind. The whole affair was\\n', 'conducted with a fine sense of ceremony.\\n', '\\n', 'As for the three elderly geisha, they took another way of complimenting\\n', 'us. Instead of making ceremonious speeches they continued to be gay and\\n', 'amusing, but they did something which, when geisha do it, is considered\\n', 'a mark of high respect. They left the place with us, accompanying us as\\n', 'far as the gate of the Yoshiwara. One of them, a jolly old creature,\\n', 'with a fine, strong humorous face, linked arms with me as we walked\\n', 'along, and conversed with me in English. Perhaps the word \"conversed\"\\n', 'implies too much. Her entire English vocabulary consisted of the words:\\n', '\"All right,\" but she repeated the expression frequently and with\\n', 'changing intonations which gave a sort of variety.\\n', '\\n', 'It was a strange evening, and the strangest part of it was the absence\\n', 'of vulgarity.

Thus came the first\\n', 'period of landscape gardening in Nippon, the Tempyo period.\\n', '\\n', 'Five and a half centuries ago the second period began when, in the\\n', 'terrain surrounding the Kinkakuji Temple at Kyoto, gardens containing\\n', 'lakes, rocks, and gold-pavilioned islands were constructed in\\n', 'resemblance to the natural scenery near the mouth of the Yangtse River\\n', 'in China.\\n', '\\n', 'The third period is best represented by the gardens of the arsenal in\\n', 'Tokyo. These were made three hundred years ago by a Chinese master named\\n', 'Shunsui, who was brought to Japan for the purpose by the Lord of Mito,\\n', 'brother of the shogun who at that time ruled Japan.

First of all, you have hills of interesting contours, made by\\n', 'eruptions. Then you have mountain lakes which form in the beds of\\n', 'extinct volcanoes. Our famous Lake Chuzenji, above Nikko, for example.\\n', 'From these lakes the water overflows, making splendid falls, like those\\n', 'of Kegon, which empty out of Lake Chuzenji. Below the falls you have a\\n', 'torrent rushing down a rocky valley, like the River Daiya, which flows\\n', 'from the Kegon Falls past Nikko, where it is spanned by the famous\\n', 'red-lacquered bridge. There is the basis for your entire garden\\n', 'composition.\\n', '\\n', '\"But you must also remember that volcanic outpourings make rich soil.\\n', 'This soil, thrown into the air by volcanic explosions, settles in the\\n', 'crevices of rocks. Pines take root in it. But in some places the pocket\\n', 'of soil is small; wherefore the roots of the pine cannot spread, and the\\n', 'tree becomes a dwarf, gnarled and picturesque. Again, on the hillsides\\n', 'the rich soil makes great trees grow, with rich shrubbery and verdure\\n', 'beneath them. The torrent completes the landscape effect by sculpturing\\n', 'the rocks into fascinating forms. In that combination you have every\\n', 'element required.

During\\n', 'that time he stood and made an address, moved about the room, and even\\n', 'stepped out to the garden, yet I was not once reminded of his physical\\n', 'handicap.

Japan is not governed by a hereditary ruling class. The government\\n', 'service is open to all men, under a system of competitive examinations,\\n', 'and promotion does not go by family or favour, but is in almost all\\n', 'cases a recognition of ability exhibited in minor offices. Young men in\\n', 'the consular service are in line for ambassadorships and may reasonably\\n', 'hope, if they exhibit great talents, ultimately to reach the highest\\n', 'offices.\\n', '\\n', 'It would seem, moreover, that in Japan as in some other lands,\\n', 'aristocratic and wealthy families do not, as a rule, produce the\\n', 'strongest men.

Strong men belonging\\n', 'to the clans which had supported the Imperial House became the strong\\n', 'men of the centralized government. Even to-day, when clans, as such, no\\n', 'longer exist, the old clan sentiment survives, with the result that men\\n', 'of Satsuma and Choshu origin are most influential in politics.

They could make laws, issue paper money, levy taxes, impose\\n', 'labour and punishment on the people, or arbitrarily take from them\\n', 'property or life itself.\\n', '\\n', 'It was a land without railroads, without steam power, without\\n', 'window-glass; a land in which nobles journeyed by the highroads in\\n', 'magnificent processions, surrounded by their soldiers, mounted and\\n', 'afoot, their lacquered palanquins, their coolie bearers; a land in\\n', 'which, when great lords passed, humble citizens fell to their knees and\\n', 'touched their foreheads to the ground; a land of duels, feuds,\\n', 'vendettas, clan wars; a land in which the samurai, or gentry, alone were\\n', 'allowed to wear swords, and in which one of the privileges most highly\\n', 'prized by the samurai was that of dying by his own hand, if condemned to\\n', 'death, instead of by the hand of the executioner. Involved with the\\n', 'privilege of _hara-kiri_, or _seppuku_, was a property right. The\\n', 'property of a man beheaded by the executioner was confiscated, whereas\\n', 'one committing hara-kiri could leave his estate to his family.\\n', '\\n', 'The education of young men varied in those times according to rank.\\n', 'Youths of the aristocracy were instructed in the Chinese classics, which\\n', 'in Japan take the place of Latin and Greek with us.

All those\\n', 'entitled to wear swords studied swordsmanship, and the process by which\\n', 'they learned it was sometimes severe, for it was the custom of masters\\n', 'to attack the pupil suddenly from behind, or even when he was asleep at\\n', 'night, on the theory that he should be ready at all times to defend\\n', 'himself. A samurai found killed with his sword completely sheathed was\\n', 'disgraced. At least two inches of the blade must show in proof that the\\n', 'dead man had attempted a defence. Jiu-jutsu was also taught to many\\n', 'samurai youths, and in this, as in swordsmanship, it was the practice of\\n', 'instructors to make surprise attacks upon their pupils.\\n', '\\n', \"Viscount Shibusawa's recollections of old days, as he recounted them to\\n\", 'me, will make a separate chapter, but before that chapter is begun, let\\n', 'me mention several points of samurai tradition--among them jiu-jutsu,\\n', 'and the more advanced art or science of jiudo, developed by my friend\\n', 'Mr. Jigoro Kano.\\n', '\\n', 'As after the Restoration the craze for all things American and European\\n', 'spread through Japan, the old arts of jiu-jutsu, which for more than\\n', 'three centuries had been practised by samurai, fell into disuse.

Needless to say, the ice-cream was no longer\\n', 'ice-cream when he got back to the hotel, and he himself was not very\\n', 'comfortable.\\n', '\\n', '\"The Paris Exposition of 1867 was in progress when we arrived. When it\\n', 'was over we travelled through Switzerland, Holland, Belgium, Italy, and\\n', 'England. Originally it was planned that after our official tour we\\n', 'should settle down to study, and I was eager for this time to come.\\n', 'However, it was not long before we received news that the shogunate had\\n', 'fallen.\\n', '\\n', '\"The news was puzzling. I could not gather what was happening in Japan.\\n', 'First I heard that Yoshinobu, as shogun, had publicly returned full\\n', 'authority of the Emperor, but later came word of the battle of\\n', 'Toba-Fushimi, in which troops of the Imperial Party defeated troops of\\n', 'the Shogun. This made it appear that Yoshinobu had played false, first\\n', \"publicly relinquishing the shogun's power and then fighting to maintain\\n\", 'it. These seemingly conflicting acts puzzled me, for I knew that\\n', 'Yoshinobu was a man of the highest honour.\\n', '\\n', '\"Presently came a messenger from Japan saying that Akitaké had become\\n', 'head of the Mito branch of the Tokugawa family, which made it necessary\\n', 'for us to abandon our plans and return. We sailed from England in\\n', 'December 1867, reaching Japan in November 1868, eleven months later.\\n', '\\n', '\"I was dumbfounded by the changes I found. Though I knew that the Shogun\\n', 'Government had fallen I had not visualized what that would mean. My\\n', 'lord, Yoshinobu, was held prisoner in a house in Suruga. Learning that\\n', 'he was allowed to see his intimate friends and retainers, I journeyed to\\n', 'Suruga, where I had audience with him several times. I found him\\n', 'reticent, and was able to get from him little information as to the\\n', 'mysterious course he had pursued.\\n', '\\n', '\"After having been held prisoner for a year he was released, but he\\n', 'continued for thirty years to reside in the neighbourhood of Suruga,\\n', 'leading a secluded life. Not until thirty-one years after his\\n', 'resignation of the shogunate did he come to Tokyo. Four years later the\\n', 'Emperor created him a prince of the new régime. This showed pretty\\n', 'clearly that the Emperor had not mistrusted him.\\n', '\\n', '\"For twenty years after my return to Japan I was unable to get at the\\n', 'bottom of this matter. I tried to get some explanation from Yoshinobu\\n', 'himself, but he evaded my inquiries. Meanwhile the question was\\n', 'constantly discussed in Japan. Those hostile to Yoshinobu contended that\\n', 'he had not acted with sincerity, having been led by the burdens\\n', 'connected with the opening of foreign relations, to lay down the\\n', 'shogunate, and having later changed his mind and fought to retain it. On\\n', 'the face of it, this seemed true. Yoshinobu was called a coward and a\\n', 'traitor, and was severely criticized for having escaped after the battle\\n', 'of Toba-Fushimi.\\n', '\\n', '\"On the other hand, those who supported Yoshinobu asserted that he had\\n', 'acted logically and wisely: that he had seen that his government was\\n', 'going to fall, and had been entirely honest in surrendering the\\n', 'shogunate prior to the battle. These adherents insisted that he had not\\n', 'wanted a battle, but had set out for Kyoto to see the Emperor with a\\n', 'view to arranging details, especially with regard to the future welfare\\n', 'of his retainers. \"But when a great lord, travelled, in those times, he\\n', \"travelled with an army, and Yoshinobu's defenders maintained that this\\n\", 'was what had brought on the battle--that when the men of Choshu and\\n', 'Satsuma learned that Yoshinobu was moving toward Kyoto with his\\n', 'soldiers, they came out and attacked him, believing, or pretending to\\n', 'believe, that he was on a hostile errand.\\n', '\\n', '\"At this time the Emperor was but seventeen years of age, and the\\n', 'Government was in the hands of elder statesmen of the Imperial Party.\\n', 'The Emperor himself probably had no idea on what errand Yoshinobu was\\n', 'approaching Kyoto; and whether the elder statesmen knew or not, they\\n', 'belonged to clans hostile to the shogunate, and preferred to fight.\\n', '\\n', '\"Many years passed before the truth began to become clear. At last, when\\n', 'the old wounds were pretty well healed, I undertook the compilation of a\\n', \"history of Yoshinobu's life and times. Finally I asked him point-blank\\n\", 'about the events connected with his resignation and the subsequent\\n', 'battle. He told me that he had indeed started to Kyoto on a peaceful\\n', 'errand, but that when the forces sent out by the great clansmen\\n', 'appeared, he could not control his own men. He had neither sought nor\\n', 'desired battle. Feeling that his highest duty was to the Emperor, he\\n', 'withdrew from the battle, taking no part in it, and returned whence he\\n', 'had come, going into retirement. He knew, of course, that the battle\\n', 'would put him in a false light, and he decided that the wisest and most\\n', 'honourable course for him to pursue was to show, by his life in\\n', 'retirement, his absolute submission to the Emperor.\\n', '\\n', '\"In order fully to appreciate why Yoshinobu was so ready to lay down his\\n', 'power, the old Japanese doctrine of loyalty to the throne must be fully\\n', 'grasped. This loyalty amounts to a religion, and permeates the whole\\n', 'life of Japan. That is why the shoguns who for so many centuries ruled\\n', 'Japan, never attempted to usurp imperial rank, but were satisfied, while\\n', 'usurping the power, to preserve the form of governing always as\\n', 'vice-regents.\\n', '\\n', '\"It is my personal belief that when Yoshinobu Tokugawa accepted the\\n', 'shogunate despite the opposition of his trusted retainers, he did so\\n', 'with the full intention of restoring to the Imperial House its rightful\\n', 'power. I used to ask him about this, and while he never admitted it, he\\n', 'never denied it. That was characteristic of him. He was the most modest\\n', 'and self-effacing of men--the last man who would have claimed for\\n', 'himself the credit for performing a self-sacrificing and heroic act of\\n', 'patriotism.

He was not interested\\n', 'in telling me of his own career, but he was profoundly interested in\\n', 'seeing that I, being a writer, should understand the relationship of\\n', 'Prince Yoshinobu to the Imperial Restoration.

His mother and I have just had\\n', '    him on a short trip in the country.\\n', '\\n', '    I was delighted to meet General Kuroki and Admiral Ijuin with\\n', '    their staffs. General Kuroki is, of course, one of the most\\n', '    illustrious men living. Through his interpreter, a very able\\n', '    young staff officer, I spoke to him a little about our troubles\\n', '    on the Pacific Slope.\\n', '\\n', '    Nothing during my Presidency has given me more concern than\\n', '    these troubles. History often teaches by example, and I think we\\n', '    can best understand just what the situation is, and how it ought\\n', '    to be met, by taking into account the change in general\\n', '    international relations during the last two or three centuries.\\n', '\\n', '    During this period all the civilized nations have made great\\n', '    progress. During the first part of it Japan did not appear in\\n', '    the general progress, but for the last half century she has gone\\n', '    ahead so much faster than any other nation that I think we can\\n', '    fairly say that, taking the last three centuries together, her\\n', '    advance has been on the whole greater than that of any other\\n', '    nation. But all have advanced, and especially in the way in\\n', '    which the people of each treat people of other nationalities.\\n', '    Two centuries ago there was the greatest suspicion and\\n', '    malevolence exhibited by all the people, high and low, of each\\n', '    European country, for all the people, high and low, of every\\n', '    other European country, with but few exceptions. The cultivated\\n', '    people of the different countries, however, had already begun to\\n', '    treat with one another on good terms. But when, for instance,\\n', '    the Huguenots were exiled from France, and great numbers of\\n', '    Huguenot workmen went to England, their presence excited the\\n', '    most violent hostility, manifesting itself even in mob violence,\\n', '    among the English workmen. The men were closely allied by race\\n', '    and religion, they had practically the same type of ancestral\\n', '    culture, and yet they were unable to get on together. Two\\n', '    centuries have passed, the world has moved forward, and now\\n', '    there could be no repetition of such hostilities. In the same\\n', '    way a marvellous progress has been made in the relations of\\n', '    Japan with the Occidental nations. Fifty years ago you and I and\\n', \"    those like us could not have travelled in one another's\\n\", '    countries. We should have had very unpleasant and possibly very\\n', '    dangerous experiences. But the same progress that has been going\\n', '    on as between nations in Europe and their descendants in America\\n', '    and Australia, has also been going on as between Japan and the\\n', '    Occidental nations. In these times, then, gentlemen, all\\n', '    educated people, members of professions and the like, get on so\\n', \"    well together that they not only travel each in the other's\\n\", '    country, but associate on the most intimate terms. Among the\\n', '    friends whom I especially value I include a number of Japanese\\n', '    gentlemen. But the half century has been too short a time for\\n', '    the advance to include the labouring classes of the two\\n', '    countries, as between themselves.\\n', '\\n', '    Exactly as the educated classes in Europe, among the several\\n', '    nations, grew to be able to associate together generations\\n', '    before it was possible for such association to take place among\\n', '    the men who had no such advantages of education, so it is\\n', '    evident we must not press too fast in bringing the labouring\\n', '    classes of Japan and America together. Already in these fifty\\n', '    years we have completely attained the goal as between the\\n', '    educated and the intellectual classes of the two countries. We\\n', '    must be content to wait another generation before we shall have\\n', '    made progress enough to permit the same close intimacy between\\n', '    the classes who have had less opportunity for cultivation, and\\n', '    whose lives are less easy, so that each has to feel, in earning\\n', '    its daily bread, the pressure of the competition of the other. I\\n', '    have become convinced that to try to move too far forward all at\\n', '    once is to incur jeopardy of trouble. This is just as true of\\n', '    one nation as of the other. If scores of thousands of American\\n', '    miners went to Saghalin, or of American mechanics to Japan or\\n', '    Formosa, trouble would almost certainly ensue. Just in the same\\n', '    way scores of thousands of Japanese labourers, whether\\n', '    agricultural or industrial, are certain, chiefly because of the\\n', '    pressure caused thereby, to be a sources of trouble if they\\n', '    should come here or to Australia. I mention Australia because it\\n', '    is a part of the British Empire, because the Australians have\\n', '    discriminated against continental immigration in favour of\\n', '    immigration from the British Isles, and have in effect\\n', '    discriminated to a certain degree in favour of immigration from\\n', '    England and Scotland as against immigration from Ireland.\\n', '\\n', '    My dear Baron, the business of statesmen is to try constantly to\\n', '    keep international relations better, to do away with causes of\\n', '    friction, and secure as nearly ideal justice as actual\\n', '    conditions will permit. I think that with this object in view\\n', '    and facing conditions not as I would like them to be, but as\\n', '    they are, the best thing to do is to prevent the labouring\\n', '    classes of either country from going in any numbers to the\\n', '    other. In a generation I believe all need of such prevention\\n', '    will have passed away; and at any rate this leaves free the\\n', '    opportunity for all those fit to profit by intercourse, to go\\n', \"    each to the other's country.

The militarists, though they still control the\\n', 'Government, are less aggressive than they used to be, both because the\\n', 'Japanese public protests when too much aggressiveness is shown, and\\n', 'because the more intelligent members of the militaristic group now\\n', 'realize that if Japan were to bring on a great war she would inevitably\\n', 'be ruined.

With Belgium the situation was even worse than with\\n', 'England. Yet through industrializing themselves both countries have\\n', 'prospered greatly. Is it not then logical to suppose that by following a\\n', 'similar course Japan will likewise prosper? Recent statistics seem,\\n', 'moreover, to indicate that with industrialization the birth-rate tends\\n', 'to decline.\\n', '\\n', 'In attempting a great industrial programme Japan has two advantages: she\\n', 'has abundant cheap labour and a short haul to the great markets of Asia.\\n', 'Geographically we are her nearest competitor for Asiatic trade, yet we\\n', 'have at the very least, four thousand miles farther to carry our goods.\\n', 'Obviously this is an immense disadvantage to us, and we are further\\n', 'handicapped by the high cost of our labour.\\n', '\\n', 'Having us at so great a disadvantage in the matter of commerce with\\n', 'Asia, it would seem that Japan should have little difficulty in securing\\n', \"for herself the lion's share of the Asiatic trade.\\n\", '\\n', 'But it must not be supposed that Japan has as yet become sufficiently\\n', 'industrialized to solve her problem.

I visited a huge cotton mill near Tokyo which was\\n', 'clearly a first-class institution of the kind; also I was much struck,\\n', 'in going through a penitentiary, by the evidences of their understanding\\n', 'of modern and enlightened practice in the conduct of penal\\n', 'establishments; and I might go on with a list of other institutions\\n', 'which impressed me favourably.\\n', '\\n', 'But that is not the side I wish here to bring out. On the contrary, I\\n', 'wish to call attention to the fact that the high degree of efficiency\\n', 'shown by the Japanese in certain instances serves but to emphasize their\\n', 'widespread inefficiency in others.\\n', '\\n', 'In an earlier chapter I spoke of the fact that in Japan one sees three\\n', 'men instead of two in the cab of a locomotive, that hand-carts are used\\n', 'for watering city streets, and that more servants are required there\\n', 'than here in a house of given size. These are but minor items in the\\n', 'wholesale waste of labour. It is as if Japan said to herself: \"I have\\n', 'all these people to look after and I must put as many of them as\\n', 'possible on every job.\" And that, in my judgment, is not the way Japan\\n', 'should look at it. Instead of putting on every job more people than are\\n', 'actually needed, she should endeavour to develop her industries to such\\n', \"a point that there will be a full, honest day's work for everyone. For,\\n\", 'of course, her labour wastage keeps up her manufacturing and operating\\n', 'costs.\\n', '\\n', 'An example of the way time is wasted may be seen wherever railroad gangs\\n', 'are at work. They swing their picks to the accompaniment of a song, and\\n', 'the rhythm is taken from the slowest man. Wastage is also exhibited in\\n', 'the way a house is built. They build the framework of the roof upon the\\n', 'ground. Then they take it apart. Then they go up and put it together all\\n', 'over again, in place. A whole house is constructed in this way.

I know of a great manufacturing plant in Japan which, if\\n', 'you were to go through it, you would call thoroughly modern. The\\n', 'buildings are modern, the machinery is modern. But there is one thing\\n', 'missing, and it is a vital thing. The plant stands a good half mile from\\n', 'the railway line; coal and raw materials are transported from car to\\n', 'factory in carts, or in baskets carried on the backs of coolies, and the\\n', 'finished product is removed in like manner.\\n', '\\n', 'Though the cost of labour in Japan was trebled after the war, wages are\\n', 'still low as compared with other countries. But this fact, which should\\n', 'be taken advantage of in the struggle for world trade, is too often used\\n', 'only as an excuse for such waste of labour as I have pointed out. And it\\n', 'is because of this and similar inefficiencies that the Japanese now find\\n', 'themselves unable to compete in costs, in certain lines, with other\\n', 'nations, even though the labour of those other nations is much better\\n', 'paid.\\n', '\\n', 'Among the things most criticized by visitors are the bad roads, both in\\n', 'the country and in the cities; the hotels, which except in a few places\\n', 'are poor (I am speaking only of the foreign-style hotels); and the\\n', 'miserable conditions of what the _Japan Advertiser_ humorously refers to\\n', 'as \"public futilities.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Tokyo, with a transportation problem which ought easily to be solved,\\n', 'has utterly inadequate street-car service.

All\\n', 'these, like the railroads, are owned and operated by the Government.\\n', '\\n', 'I began to suspect their telephones when I saw the old full-bosomed wall\\n', 'instruments they use, with bell-cranks to be rung; but little did I then\\n', 'guess the full measure of their telephonic backwardness.\\n', '\\n', 'It is like opera bouffe. Though the demand for new telephones far\\n', 'exceeds the supply, the Government makes no appreciable effort to remedy\\n', 'the situation.

Thus, if a man be lucky in the draw, he may get a\\n', 'telephone within two or three years. But I know one gentleman in Tokyo\\n', 'who was not lucky in the draw.

The\\n', 'number must, however, be in the exchange serving the district in which\\n', 'the telephone is to be placed.\\n', '\\n', 'Though this is a very expensive method, it is the one usually employed\\n', 'in Tokyo and other large cities.

This, I was informed, is because green\\n', 'operators, in process of being broken-in, sit at that end of the central\\n', 'switchboard at which the high numbers invariably occur, thus\\n', 'guaranteeing the owners of high numbers a grade of service calculated to\\n', 'drive them to the madhouse.\\n', '\\n', 'It must not be imagined that the Japanese are content with their\\n', 'telephone service. They are not. For some time prior to my arrival in\\n', 'Japan the press had been demanding a reform, and at last it was\\n', 'announced that action was about to be taken to improve matters.\\n', '\\n', 'But all that happened was this: Instead of increasing the service, the\\n', 'government functionaries started a campaign to discourage the use of\\n', 'telephones. Up to that time, unlimited service had been given. Now,\\n', 'however, a flat charge of two sen (about one cent) per call was\\n', 'announced, the theory being that many persons would think twice before\\n', 'spending two sen on an idle telephonic conversation.\\n', '\\n', 'After watching the new plan in operation for a few days the telephone\\n', 'authorities jubilantly announced that it was a great success--the number\\n', 'of calls had appreciably diminished.

For the shoji at the rear of the room were pushed\\n', 'back like the others, and from the beach on which they opened there came\\n', 'to me through the darkness an insistent note of definite and almost\\n', 'terrible reality: the murmur of that ocean, black, restless, turbulent,\\n', 'ominous, unimaginably vast, by which I was cut off from home.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '                   *       *       *       *       *\\n', '\\n', 'My own room was next to that of the linguist, but the room beyond mine\\n', 'was occupied by a Japanese couple.

On one occasion they are overcrowded, on\\n', 'another we carry them half empty. My own bags remind me of the way I\\n', 'used to feel about wine bottles in the cheery days when one could afford\\n', 'to regard such things with a somewhat critical eye.

Let us, however, drop\\n', 'this subject. _De mortuis_....\\n', '\\n', 'I was often struck with the fact that though the Japanese woman seems to\\n', 'be more heavily dressed than the foreign woman, and though her coiffure\\n', 'is generally more elaborate, she carries so much less baggage when she\\n', \"travels. In our Yuki's furoshiki there was always room for my cigars,\\n\", 'cigarettes, books, and kodak films. Her own things seemed to take no\\n', 'space at all.\\n', '\\n', 'There are several reasons for this. A Japanese woman carries no\\n', 'hair-brush and wears her comb in her hair. Nor do the Japanese generally\\n', 'take nightclothes with them on a journey, for a clean cotton kimono, in\\n', 'which to sleep, is supplied by all Japanese hotels. More than once, when\\n', \"I saw Yuki starting off with us for a two- or three-days' trip with\\n\", 'baggage consisting of a furoshiki tied to about the size of two ordinary\\n', 'novels, I thought of Johnnie Poe\\'s famous \"fifty-three pieces of\\n', 'baggage--a deck of cards and a tooth-brush.\"\\n', '\\n', 'A favourite theme for the decoration of the furoshiki embodies the signs\\n', 'of the Chinese zodiac, consisting of twelve animals. The Chinese\\n', 'calendar was adopted centuries ago by the Japanese, and they still take\\n', 'account of it, though they now generally use our Gregorian calendar for\\n', 'computing time. But even so, their era is not the Christian Era, but\\n', 'dates from the beginning of the reign of Jimmu Tenno the Divine, whom\\n', 'the Japanese count as the first of their Imperial line, and who is said\\n', 'to have ascended the throne, 660 B.C. Thus our current year, 1921, is\\n', 'the year 2581 in Japan. Time is also measured arbitrarily by the reigns\\n', 'of emperors, the present year being Taisho 10, or the tenth year of the\\n', 'reign of the present Emperor.\\n', '\\n', 'The Chinese zodiac, however, figures largely in Japanese superstition.\\n', 'As there are twelve animals, the years are counted off in cycles of\\n', 'twelve; and the same animals are also associated with days and hours, in\\n', 'cycles of twelve. The attributes of the astrological animal governing\\n', \"the year of one's birth are supposed to attach to one.\\n\", '\\n', '\"My mother is a cow,\" a Japanese lady explained to me. \"My husband is a\\n', 'snake and I am a rabbit.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The lore of these animals is complicated. I have only a smattering of\\n', 'it, but what I know will suffice to show the general tendency of such\\n', 'superstition.\\n', '\\n', 'It is considered good fortune to be born in the year of the horse\\n', 'because the horse is strong and energetic. 1920 was the year of the\\n', 'monkey. It is unlucky to marry in monkey year because the word _saru_,\\n', 'which means \"monkey,\" also means \"to go back,\" the suggestion being that\\n', 'the bride will go back to her former home, or in other words be\\n', 'divorced. A woman born in the year of the rabbit will be prolific. (The\\n', 'lady who said, \"I\\'m a rabbit,\" though very young, was the mother of\\n', 'four.)\\n', '\\n', 'Similarly the animals, in their cycle, bring good luck or ill luck in\\n', 'connection with events occurring on certain days. It is unlucky to take\\n', \"to one's bed with a sickness on the day of the cow, because the cow is\\n\", 'slow to get up. It is lucky to begin a journey on the day of the tiger,\\n', 'because the tiger, though he travels a thousand miles, always returns to\\n', 'the point from which he started; but for the same reason it is unlucky\\n', 'for a girl to marry on this day, because she, like the tiger, may return\\n', \"to the place from which she started: her father's house. And the day of\\n\", 'the tiger is a bad one for funerals, because the tiger drags its prey\\n', 'with it, suggesting that another funeral will soon follow. The\\n', 'significance attaching to each animal according to the Japanese idea is\\n', 'not always apparent, without explanation, to the stranger. For instance,\\n', 'though I know it is considered lucky for a bride to cut her kimonos on\\n', 'the day of the rooster, I do not know why. Nor do I know why it is\\n', 'considered particularly lucky to have, in one family, three persons born\\n', 'under the same sign.\\n', '\\n', 'Superstition of all kinds plays a large part in the daily life of the\\n', 'Japanese masses, and persons of intelligence often patronize fortune\\n', 'tellers, among whom are the Buddhist priests in certain temples.\\n', '\\n', '    [Illustration: At Asakusa, the great popular temple of Tokyo,\\n', '    the fortune-telling business is so brisk that two or three\\n', '    priests are busy at it all the time]\\n', '\\n', 'At Asakusa, the great popular temple of Tokyo, the fortune-telling\\n', 'business is so brisk that two or three priests are busy at it all the\\n', 'time.

He saw a pile of them on\\n', 'the counter. His heart bounded. The grocer was waiting upon an old lady.\\n', 'He was about to wrap something up. Monet saw him reach for one of the\\n', 'prints.\\n', '\\n', \"'No, no!' he cried. 'I want to buy that! I want to buy all those--all\\n\", \"those!'\\n\", '\\n', '\"The grocer was a good man. He believed that he was dealing with some\\n', 'one who was a little touched. Anyway the coloured papers had cost him\\n', 'nothing. They were thrown in with the goods. Like some one who gives a\\n', 'toy to a crying child to appease it, he gave the pile of prints to\\n', 'Monet, smilingly and a bit mockingly.\\n', '\\n', '\"\\'Take them, take them,\\' he said. \\'You can have them. They aren\\'t worth\\n', 'anything. They aren\\'t solid enough. I prefer regular wrapping-paper.\\'\"\\n', '\\n', \"So the grocer enveloped the old lady's cheese in a piece of yellow\\n\", 'paper, and Monet went home and spent the rest of the day in adoration of\\n', 'his new-found treasures. The names of the great Japanese wood-engravers\\n', 'were of course unknown in Europe then, but Monet learned later that some\\n', 'of these prints were by Hokusai, Utamaro, and Korin.\\n', '\\n', '\"This,\" continues Mirbeau, \"was the beginning of a celebrated\\n', 'collection, but much more important, it was the beginning of such an\\n', 'evolution in French painting that the anecdote has, besides its own\\n', 'savour, a veritable historic value.
