Extra Credit:

3. Used dataset larger than 5000 entries. The NBA dataset contains 24.7k entries, breaking down each and every player from 1950 to 2018 and their seasons. 
4. Used at least 2 matplotlib visualizations to answer the second question I proposed for the NBA dataset. Matplotlib usage begins at line 388.
